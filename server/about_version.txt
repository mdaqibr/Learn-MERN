let suppose 
there is version written like this:

4.18.4

So here there are three parts of the version.
1st -> 4
2nd -> 18
3rd -> 4

When 
  - 1st number is changed, it means that it is major update.(Major release/Breaking update)
  - 2nd number is changed, it means it is a recommended update (recommended bug fix, security fix)
  - 3rd number is changed, it means it is a minor update( minor fix)

Sometimes we see (^) this symbol in the version:
for example - ^4.19.4
it means whenever we update the version then it will automatically choose the compatible recommended and minor updates but not change the major update number.
only change (2nd and 3rd number not 1st number)

And also we see (~) this symbol:
So it means when we update the package it will be automatically choose the compatible minor update only(only change 3rd number.)
